Experiment with prompt engineering in a hands-on and fun way. In a short time, you can build, share, and remix apps, to get inspired while playing with generative AI. For example, you can:\rBuild an app to generate dad jokes on the topic of your choice.\rCreate the perfect playlist based on your musical tastes.\rRecommend what to serve based on ingredients in your pantry.\rCreate and play a virtual trivia game online with friends from around the world.\rCreate an AI storyteller to guide your next fantasy -playing campaign.\rBy building and playing with PartyRock apps, you learn about the fundamental techniques and capabilities needed to get started with generative AI, including understanding how a foundation model responds to a given prompt, experimenting with different text-based prompts, and chaining prompts together. Anyone can access PartyRock through its intuitive web-based UI. For anyone interested in learning the fundamental skills needed to harness the power of generative AI, PartyRock uses Amazon Bedrock to create an accessible environment for experimentation with powerful foundational models (FMs). The tool builds confidence by providing new PartyRock users with free trial use for a limited time, and the PartyRock Guide helps learners extend their knowledge. Builders who are ready to move into production can proceed to the Bedrock console using the basic prompts and skills developed in PartyRock.\rAny builder can experiment with PartyRock by creating a profile using a social login from amazon.com, Apple, or Google. PartyRock is separate from the AWS console and does not require an AWS account to get started.\rPartyRock is for EVERYONE. It has been designed in a way that is friendly and accessible to builders of all skill levels, particularly those who have limited experience with generative AI. Even if you have no coding experience, you can use text-based prompts to experiment with foundation models and create your own generative AI-powered apps. Developers can explore model capabilities and refine prompt engineering techniques in PartyRock without managing API calls. Never include sensitive information in PartyRock!\n"
