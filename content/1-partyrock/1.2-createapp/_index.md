You can try this app here: https://partyrock.aws/u/js2222/9ktuP8ntP/PaintBrush 

#### Introduction

In this lab, we will build a generative AI app just by describing what we want PartyRock to create. PartyRock offers an **app builder feature** that takes your idea and automatically creates an app from it. You can then either run it as-is, customize it in the app editor, or delete it.

In the steps below, we will build an image generation app that allows you to specify a painting subject and style. Feel free to try your own app idea if you prefer!

#### Generate app with App Builder
