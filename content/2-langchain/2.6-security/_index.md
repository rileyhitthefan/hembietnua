In these security and safeguards labs, we'll learn how to use [Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/) to implement custom policies to protect your generative AI applications.

These labs do not require any additional supporting infrastructure or integrations beyond Bedrock API calls.

Each lab is self-contained, and can be done in any order.
