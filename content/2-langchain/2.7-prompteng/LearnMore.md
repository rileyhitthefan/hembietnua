While general best practices for prompt engineering are still emerging, it is best to understand how each model works. Some prompts may be portable between providers, but many won't. You will likely need to alter and optimize your prompts if you want to try different providers.

Below are prompt engineering guides provided by some of Amazon Bedrock's model providers:
