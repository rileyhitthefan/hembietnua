**Prompt engineering** is the art of communicating with large language models. A **prompt** is the message sent to a model in order to generate a response. Prompt engineering may involve:

- Word choice
- Phrasing
- Providing additional information
- Providing examples

These labs will give you a chance to learn how to solve a wide range of problems using prompt engineering techniques. You will be able to experiment with prompts across Bedrock's model providers, and compare the results.

Each lab is self-contained, and can be done in any order once the [prompt app setup]() is complete.
