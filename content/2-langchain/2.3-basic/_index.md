These labs assume no previous experience with Amazon Bedrock, LangChain, or Streamlit. They will introduce you to the core patterns for working with foundation models. All the other labs in the workshop build on these patterns.

These patterns can be used to solve some basic real-world use cases. These labs do not require any additional supporting infrastructure or integrations beyond Bedrock API calls.

Each lab is self-contained, and can be done in any order.

- [Lab B-1: Text generation](LabB-1.md)
- [Lab B-2: Image generation](LabB-2.md)
- [Lab B-3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation](LabB-3.md)
- [Lab B-4: Chatbot](LabB-4.md)
