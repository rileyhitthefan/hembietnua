These labs assume no previous experience with Amazon Bedrock, LangChain, or Streamlit. That said, if you haven't used one or more of these before, you would benefit from doing the [Basic pattern labs](../2.3-basic/_index.md) in the workshop first..

In these intermediate labs, we expand on the techniques learned in the basic labs. We will start solving more real-world use cases. These labs do not require any additional supporting infrastructure or integrations beyond Bedrock API calls.
